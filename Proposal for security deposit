Maybe this is not the place for this, but I would totally suggest that if a security deposit is coming directly from Bisq wallet, those funds get blocked instead of having to actually send them to the network. 
It would make for way faster processing, and it might help mitigating the current miscalculation of correct mining fee that creates unnecessary (and serious) delays on trades.
On top of that, it would encourage users to always keep some funds on their Bisq wallet.
